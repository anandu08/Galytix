Suggestions for improvements and scope of optimizations in the future


Optimize Vector Calculations: Use in-place operations where possible to avoid creating new numpy arrays and reduce memory usage.



Vector Normalization: Check if the vector is a zero vector before normalizing to avoid division by zero errors.

Data Structures: Consider using data structures that are more efficient for the task at hand. For example, a priority queue could be used to find the best match in find_closest_match

Code Efficiency: The calculate_normalized_embedding method is called multiple times for the same phrase in find_closest_match. Consider optimizing this by storing the results for reuse
